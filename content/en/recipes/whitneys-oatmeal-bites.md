PB & chocolate craving banisher. Addicted? [Blame Whitney.](https://twitter.com/witlegit/status/1663628660300038146)

## Ingredients

- 1 cup oatmeal
- 1/2 cup flaxseed (ground or whole, you’ll get a slightly different resulting texture)
- 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup peanut butter
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder

Optional add-ins: semisweet chocolate chips, chopped nuts, dried cranberries.

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients and refrigerate for 15-30 min to help the oats absorb moisture and the flaxseed to bind.
2. Form the mixture into bite-size balls and place on a tray.
3. Chill until they firm up. Store in the fridge — not like they’ll be in there too long!
4. Try not to eat them all at once.

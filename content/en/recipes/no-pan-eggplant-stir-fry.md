Delectable chinese eggplant stir fry without the cleanup.

## Ingredients

1. Medium purple eggplant
2. Sweet chilli sauce
3. Soy sauce or soy sauce alternative

Optional seasonings: dried green onions, garlic powder, onion powder.

## Instructions

1. Wash eggplant and trim off pointed flaps of stem. Pierce with a fork all over.
2. Place on a microwave-safe dish and cover. Cook on high for five minutes, or until eggplant is softened and appears somewhat deflated.
3. Test for doneness with a fork; if eggplant is still firm in the middle, continue cooking until it is soft throughout. Once cooked, let stand a minute to cool.
4. Slice eggplant into roughly 1-inch cubes and add sauces and seasonings. Stir and serve.
